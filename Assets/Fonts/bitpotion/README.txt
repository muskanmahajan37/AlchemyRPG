BitPotion is a pixel font available in both TTF and Bitmap formats (.png + .fnt).

The font contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and a range of commonly used symbols. BitPotion Extended adds a large range of Latin accented characters and a further range of symbols.

The average size of the characters is 4x7 for uppercase letters and 4x5 for lowercase, stretching to 7 with ascenders/descenders.

Works best if used at font sizes in multiples of 16.

This font is free to use in both personal and commercial projects. Credit would be preferred. If you use it in a project of yours, I'd love to know about it!
